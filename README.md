# Radium Theme for Visual Studio Code

## Overview
The Radium Theme for Visual Studio Code is a port of the popular Radium theme originally developed for NvChad. This theme aims to bring the sleek, modern aesthetic of the Radium theme to the Visual Studio Code environment. 

## Status
This theme is currently in development and not all features are fully functional yet. Efforts are being made to achieve as close a match to the original NvChad Radium theme as possible. Some elements and colors might not be perfectly identical due to the differences in theme engines between NvChad and Visual Studio Code.

## Credits
All credits for the original theme design and concept go to the authors and contributors of the [NvChad Radium theme](https://github.com/NvChad). This port is made with admiration for their excellent work and is intended to broaden its reach to users of Visual Studio Code.
